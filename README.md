# BOT BATTLR

  by Christine K juma.

  ## Description

This web application demonstrates a data React application that displays a list of my recent bot profiles, among other features 

such as Adding an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should  render in the `BotArmy` component. The bot can be 

enlisted only **once**. The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
  
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `BotArmy` component.
